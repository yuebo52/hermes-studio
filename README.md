## Core Capabilities

| Area | What Hermes Studio does |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-agent runtime | Runs Hermes, Ekko, Claude Code, Codex, and Pi with streaming responses, tool traces, generated-file previews, persistent sessions, and standalone desktop chat windows. |
| Studio workspace | Provides shared chats, group chat, global-agent runs, workflows, files, voice, media, devices, themes, logs, usage, and App connectivity across agent runtimes. |
| Agent control planes | Keeps Hermes profiles, providers, models, memory, skills, plugins, jobs, Kanban, channels, and runtime management in their owning agent module. |
| Automation | Builds executable visual workflows and connects the five runtimes through schedules, approval gates, group-chat rooms, platform channels, and MCP servers. |
| Workspace tools | Provides a file browser, web terminal, Desktop Agent Browser, voice input/output, coding-agent runners, device discovery, Journey graph, and performance views. |
| Distribution | Ships as a desktop app for Windows/macOS/Linux, an npm CLI package, and a Docker image. |

## Agent and Platform Boundaries

Hermes Studio is the shared product platform, not a sixth agent. It coordinates
five concrete runtimes grouped into three agent families:

| Agent family | Runtime | Owned behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hermes | Hermes | Profiles, providers, models, skills, plugins, memory, jobs, Kanban, channels, MCP, terminal, and Hermes runtime integration. |
| Ekko | Ekko | Ekko execution, approvals, clarifications, memory, MCP, and provider runtime behavior. |
| Coding | Claude Code, Codex, Pi | Coding-agent installation, configuration, proxies, sessions, and process execution. |

Studio owns capabilities shared by those families: single chat, group chat,
global-agent orchestration, workflows, webhooks, sessions, files and uploads,
TTS/STT, media, pets, themes, devices, networking, logs, usage, authentication,
and App connectivity. Studio-owned HTTP APIs use `/api/studio/*`; Hermes-owned
control-plane APIs use `/api/hermes/*`. Already-released mobile App paths are
handled by one centralized compatibility layer instead of duplicate legacy
controllers.

## Features

### AI Chat

- Real-time chat streaming over Socket.IO `/chat-run`; Studio dispatches each run to Hermes, Ekko, Claude Code, Codex, or Pi through runtime adapters
- Multi-session management — create, rename, delete, switch between sessions
- **Self-built session database** — local SQLite storage for Studio sessions; Hermes state.db remains a read-only source for Hermes history APIs
- Session grouping by source (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.) with collapsible accordion
- Active session indicator — live sessions pin to top with spinner icon
- Sessions sorted by latest message time
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting and code copy
- Tool call detail expansion (arguments / result)
- Profile-scoped file uploads, clipboard image/file paste, and workspace attachments
- File download support — download uploaded files and agent-generated files by resolved path across local, Docker, SSH, and Singularity backends
- Inline previews for generated HTML, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, images, Markdown, and source files
- Session search — Ctrl+K search across the Studio local session database; read-only Hermes history sessions are not included
- Session categories, message references, compression progress, and durable background delegation results
- Profile-aware model selector — discovers models available to the signed-in account through authorized Hermes profiles
- Per-session model display badge and context token usage

### Platform Channels

Unified configuration for **10 platforms** in one page:

| Platform      | Features                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telegram      | Bot token, mention control, reactions, free-response chats             |

### Logs

- View agent / server / error logs
- Filter by log level, log file, and keyword
- Structured log parsing with HTTP access log highlighting

### Admin & Runtime Management

- Device and LAN peer views for local-network discovery and peer tooling
- MCP manager for the managed `hermes-studio` server, profile injection, and `api` / `browser` / `devices` / `use` toolsets
- Runtime version and version-preview tooling for testing newer builds in isolation
- Performance monitor views for super administrators

### Authentication

- Token-based auth (auto-generated on first run or set via `AUTH_TOKEN` env var)
- Username/password login with account management in Settings
- Default bootstrap credentials are `admin` / `123456`; users are prompted after login to change the default username and password
- Super administrators can manage users and profile bindings; regular administrators can manage their own account details

CLI maintenance commands:

```bash
# Delete persisted login IP lock records
hermes-web-ui clear-login-locks

# Delete login locks and restart the running Studio server
hermes-web-ui clear-login-locks --restart

# Create or reset the default super administrator login to admin / 123456
hermes-web-ui reset-default-login
```

`clear-login-locks` removes `${HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME:-~/.hermes-web-ui}/.login-lock.json`. If the server is running, restart it to clear in-memory lock state. `reset-default-login` updates the Studio account database; if an `admin` user already exists, its password is reset to `123456` and the account is enabled as a super administrator.

### Settings

- Display (streaming, compact mode, reasoning, cost display)
- Agent (max turns, timeout, tool enforcement)
- Memory (enable/disable, char limits)
- Session reset (idle timeout, scheduled reset)
- Privacy (PII redaction)
- Model settings (default model & provider)
- Profile and provider configuration

### Voice / TTS / STT

- Manage voice providers under Models → STT and Models → TTS; existing Settings → Voice links redirect there.
- TTS adapters: Edge, OpenAI-compatible, MiMo, Doubao, ElevenLabs, Gemini, xAI, Mistral, MiniMax, and DeepInfra.
- STT adapters: Browser, OpenAI-compatible, Doubao, Groq, Mistral, xAI, ElevenLabs, and DeepInfra.
- Use editable turn-based voice input from the chat mic, or open the full-screen real-time voice stage for a continuous voice-focused experience.
- Provider keys and MiMo voice-clone audio stay server-side; the browser receives only masked secret status.
- Starting a new voice turn stops current assistant playback first, but does not implicitly cancel an active agent run.
- For supported settings, security notes, and current non-goals, see [`docs/voice-dialogue.md`](./docs/voice-dialogue.md).
- The real-time stage does not claim simultaneous full-duplex listen/speak; telephony and always-on wake-word listening remain out of scope.

### Web Terminal

- Integrated terminal powered by node-pty and @xterm/xterm
- Multi-session support — create, switch between, and close terminal sessions
- Real-time keyboard input and PTY output streaming via WebSocket
- Window resize support

### Desktop App & Updates

- Native Electron shell for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Bundles the Studio runtime and starts the local server automatically
- Uses Cloudflare download endpoints for desktop auto-update metadata and assets first
- Falls back to GitHub Releases `latest` assets if the Cloudflare update feed is unavailable
- Windows upgrades attempt to close an existing Hermes Studio process before replacing files

---

## Quick Start

### Desktop App (Recommended)

Download the latest **Hermes Studio** desktop installer from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EKKOLearnAI/hermes-studio/releases/latest).

Desktop builds are published for macOS, Windows, and Linux, with separate
architecture assets where applicable. The desktop app bundles the Studio
runtime and stores Hermes Agent data in `~/.hermes` on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The desktop wrapper stores its own Studio state separately in
`~/.hermes-web-ui` unless `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME` is set.

After the packaged desktop app starts, it installs managed command shims so the
desktop app, bundled Hermes Agent CLI, and bundled server CLI do not conflict:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hermes-studio` | Open the Hermes Studio desktop app |
| `hermes-studio cli ...` | Run the bundled Hermes Agent CLI |
| `hermes-studio web ...` | Run the bundled `hermes-web-ui` command |
| `hermes-studio -h` | Show wrapper help |
| `hermes-studio-mcp [api\|browser\|devices\|use]` | Run one managed Studio MCP toolset |

Use `hermes-studio cli -h` for Hermes Agent CLI help and
`hermes-studio web -h` for server CLI help. `hermes-studio-mcp` defaults to the
`api` toolset; choose `browser`, `devices`, or `use` to keep the exposed MCP
surface focused on the current task.

Desktop auto-updates read the latest feed from
`https://download.ekkolearnai.com/latest` first. If that endpoint is
unavailable, the updater falls back to
`https://github.com/EKKOLearnAI/hermes-studio/releases/latest/download`.

### npm

```bash
npm install -g hermes-web-ui
hermes-web-ui start
```

Open **http://localhost:8648**

### Docker Compose

Single-container deployment with integrated Hermes Agent:

```bash
# Use pre-built image (Recommended)
WEBUI_IMAGE=ekkoye8888/hermes-web-ui docker compose up -d

# Or build from source
docker compose up -d --build

docker compose logs -f hermes-webui
```

Open **http://localhost:6060**

- Persistent Hermes data is stored in `./hermes_data`
- Studio auth token is stored in `./hermes_data/hermes-web-ui/.token`
- On first run with auth enabled, the token is printed to container logs
- All runtime settings are environment-variable driven in `docker-compose.yml`

For detailed notes and troubleshooting, see [`docs/docker.md`](./docs/docker.md).

### Hermes Agent Runtime Discovery

When Studio starts backend chat features, it prefers a source checkout that
contains `run_agent.py` such as `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`. If no source checkout
is found, it falls back to the Python environment used by the installed
`hermes` command, then the system Python. This supports both source installs
and package installs such as `pip install hermes-agent`.

## Studio Environment Variables

These variables configure Hermes Studio, its local Hermes runtime integration, and development/preview helpers. Provider API keys and Hermes Agent settings are normally managed through Hermes profiles; environment variables here are process-level overrides.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8648` | Studio server listen port. |
| `BIND_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Studio server bind host. Set `::` explicitly for IPv6. |
| `HERMES_LAN_ADVERTISE_URL` | unset | Reachable Studio origin used in App LAN QR codes. Set this to the Docker host's LAN URL when Studio is opened through `localhost`, for example `http://192.168.1.20:6060`. |
| `HERMES_APP_ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED` | `true` | Require a valid cloud-signed App entitlement before accepting a LAN App relay connection. Set `false` only for temporary compatibility diagnostics. |
| `HERMES_APP_ENTITLEMENT_PUBLIC_KEY` | built in | Optional PEM public-key override for RS256 App entitlements. The expected issuer is `hermes-studio-server` and audience is `ekko-studio`. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME` | `~/.hermes-web-ui` | Studio data home for auth token, credentials, logs, DB, and default uploads. `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` is also supported as a compatibility alias. |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` | unset | Compatibility alias for `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME`. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_DISABLE_MCP_AUTOINJECT` | unset | Disable startup injection of the managed `hermes-studio` MCP server into Hermes profile configs. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_ALLOW_TRANSIENT_MCP_AUTOINJECT` | unset | Allow managed MCP injection when `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME` is under a temporary directory, such as Version Preview runtimes. |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `$HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME/upload` | Upload root override. Files are stored below profile-scoped subdirectories. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | same host only | Comma- or space-separated cross-origin allowlist for HTTP, Socket.IO, and WebSocket requests. Set `*` only when you intentionally need legacy wildcard CORS. |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | auto-generated | Explicit bearer token. If unset, Studio creates one under `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME`. |
| `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` | `AUTH_TOKEN` | JWT signing secret override for username/password sessions. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `30d` | Username/password session JWT lifetime. Accepts seconds or `s`/`m`/`h`/`d` suffixes, for example `12h` or `7d`. |
| `PROFILE` | `default` | Startup/default Hermes profile. Runtime requests use the profile selected by the frontend and authorized for the current account. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Server log level. |
| `BRIDGE_LOG_LEVEL` | `$LOG_LEVEL` or `info` | Bridge log level. |
| `MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE` | `200MB` | Maximum file download size. |

| `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_UV` | auto-discovered | `uv` executable used to launch the agent bridge when available. |
| `UV` | auto-discovered | Fallback `uv` executable path. |
| `PYTHON` | auto-discovered | Fallback Python executable for the agent bridge. |
| `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT` | platform default | Agent bridge broker endpoint. Windows defaults to `tcp://127.0.0.1:18765`; macOS/Linux defaults to `ipc:///tmp/hermes-agent-bridge.sock`. |
| `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Timeout for Node requests to the bridge broker. |
| `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_CONNECT_RETRY_MS` | `5000` | Short retry window for connecting to the bridge socket. |

| `HERMES_WEB_UI_DISABLE_SKILL_INJECTION` | unset | Skip startup bundled skill injection. Set `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` when bundled skills are managed outside Studio. When injection is enabled, Studio updates only skills it previously installed or identical existing bundled copies; local edits and user-owned same-name skills are skipped. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_STOP_GATEWAYS_ON_SHUTDOWN` | enabled | Controls whether Studio shutdown also stops only the gateway processes started and tracked by this Studio process. Set `0` or `false` to detach them; externally discovered gateways are never adopted or stopped. |

| `HERMES_WEB_UI_PREVIEW_AGENT_BRIDGE_TRANSPORT` | platform default | Version Preview broker transport. Set `tcp` to use loopback TCP for Preview on macOS/Linux; when unset, Preview follows `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_WORKER_TRANSPORT=tcp`. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_PREVIEW_AGENT_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT` | isolated preview endpoint | Directly overrides the Version Preview broker endpoint. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_BACKEND_PORT` | `8648` | Backend port used by the Vite dev proxy. |
| `HERMES_WEB_UI_FRONTEND_PORT` | `8649` | Frontend Vite dev server port. |

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hermes-web-ui start [port]` | Start in background; accepts a positional port or `--port <port>` |
| `hermes-web-ui client [port]` | Start for a remote client with gateway autostart disabled and permissive CORS |
| `hermes-web-ui restart [port]` | Restart; stops the bridge by default |
| `hermes-web-ui stop` | Stop the background process |
| `hermes-web-ui status` | Check if running |
| `hermes-web-ui clear-login-locks [--restart]` | Clear persisted login locks, optionally restart |
| `hermes-web-ui reset-default-login` | Create or reset the default administrator login |
| `hermes-web-ui update` / `upgrade` | Update to the latest version and restart |
| `hermes-web-ui version` / `-v` | Show the version |
| `hermes-web-ui -h` | Show help |
| `hermes-web-ui-mcp [api\|browser\|devices\|use]` | Run one managed Studio MCP toolset (same as `hermes-studio-mcp`) |

Add `--no-open` to `start` or `client` when no browser should open.

`restart`, `update`, and `upgrade` stop the Agent Bridge broker by default so restarted or updated servers do not reuse stale Python bridge processes. Set `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_STOP_ON_SHUTDOWN=0` before restarting only when you explicitly want to keep the bridge broker and running bridge sessions alive.

`update` / `upgrade` first attempt `npm cache clean --force`, then run `npm install -g hermes-web-ui@latest` and restart. Cache cleanup is best-effort; if it fails, the updater continues with the install.

### Auto Configuration

On startup the BFF server automatically:

- Initializes Studio data directories, local databases, and bundled skills
- Starts the Hermes agent bridge used by `/chat-run`
- Opens a browser on successful startup unless `--no-open` is set

git clone https://github.com/EKKOLearnAI/hermes-studio.git
cd hermes-studio
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:8649
- BFF Server: http://localhost:8647

```bash
npm run harness:check
npm run test
npm run build   # outputs to dist/
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for contributor commands and

## Architecture

```text
Browser / Desktop / App
          │ HTTP + Socket.IO
          ▼
Koa bootstrap (composition only)
          │
          ├─ Studio platform ── chat, groups, global agent, workflows,
          │                    sessions, files, voice, devices, webhooks

          │                    Kanban, channels, terminal, Hermes bridge
          ├─ Ekko family ───── Ekko runtime and agent-owned services
          └─ Coding family ─── Claude Code, Codex, and Pi adapters
```

The server is organized by business ownership under
`packages/server/src/modules/{studio,hermes,ekko,coding-agents}`. Routes stay
thin, controllers own HTTP concerns, services own reusable behavior, and only
`packages/server/src/bootstrap` may compose concrete modules and adapters.
Cross-agent code belongs to Studio; an agent module must not absorb a shared
product surface merely because it uses that agent today.

Studio state and Hermes Agent state remain separate. Studio defaults to
`~/.hermes-web-ui`; Hermes profile data remains under the Hermes home. For the
full ownership tree, dependency rules, and API migration contract, see
[`docs/harness/server-module-boundaries.md`](./docs/harness/server-module-boundaries.md).
