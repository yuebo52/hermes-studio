feature: Group Chat handoff depth-stop presentation
impact: Show actionable handoff stops only for trusted finite depth-limit events
---

## Summary

Group Chat now persists and presents an Agent handoff depth-stop only when a trusted structured Agent handoff reaches an enabled finite depth limit. Ordinary Agent replies, disabled handoff policy, unlimited handoffs, missing trusted metadata, and messages without a concrete Agent target do not create actionable stop records.

## Impact

- Prevents internal sentinel depths from appearing as user-facing handoff history.
- Prevents disabled handoffs from being mislabeled as maximum-depth stops.
- Keeps legitimate finite depth-limit stops attached to their source message with the existing one-time continuation action.
- Canonicalizes dispatcher-only continuation metadata outside the frozen payload digest while still rejecting mismatched attempt IDs and business-payload drift.
- Freezes the selected target/runtime identity, fences queued Remote Relay configuration updates, and recovers only invocations that have not actually started.
- Moves a started Remote Relay invocation to durable `outcome_unknown` after source restart or a non-terminal transport failure. The same attempt remains the active database record, `Continue` stays unavailable, and no replay or replacement attempt is created.
- Treats an authenticated remote `run.failed` event and a durable target Agent message as authoritative terminal evidence, so known failures remain retryable and a message published just before transport loss still completes the original chain.
- Returns `HANDOFF_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` to stale clients that try to Continue and presents a localized warning card without exposing raw backend diagnostics.
- Localizes the stop card and maps persisted backend failures to user-facing locale copy instead of exposing raw English errors in non-English interfaces.
- Keeps stop history out of the Room settings form; the form remains configuration-only.

## Notes

Existing malformed rows remain non-presentable and are not mutated automatically. Cleaning persisted business Room records requires a separately authorized data migration or administrative action.
