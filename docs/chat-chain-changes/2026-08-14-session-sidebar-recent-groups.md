feature: Session sidebar recent and category groups
impact: Recent sessions remain visible in their assigned categories, while pinned sessions stay in the pinned group without consuming the recent-session limit.

The Recent group now acts as a shortcut instead of removing its sessions from
the normal category groups. Pinned sessions are selected independently and are
excluded before the recent-session partition is calculated.
